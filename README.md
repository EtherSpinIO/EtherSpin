# Overview

EtherSpin uses Oraclize's service to pull random bytes of data along with proof to generate random values for the game. By utilizing this method, all bets made by the user are provably fair and verifiable. 

Oraclize's Ledger Proof method was introduced in mid-2017, and it is a very effective way for casinos to generate and retrieve fair random numbers. For more information, see https://blog.oraclize.it/welcoming-our-brand-new-ledger-proof-649b9f098ccc
