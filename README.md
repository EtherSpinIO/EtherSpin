Welcome to EtherSpin - Ethereum Casino's Github public source code respository!

# Overview

EtherSpin uses Oraclize's service to pull random bytes of data along with proof to generate random values for the game. By utilizing this method, all bets made by the user are provably fair and verifiable. 

Oraclize's Ledger Proof method was introduced in mid-2017, and it is a very effective way for casinos to generate and retrieve fair random numbers. For more information, see https://blog.oraclize.it/welcoming-our-brand-new-ledger-proof-649b9f098ccc

Bets made through this method are resolved relatively quickly as it no longer relies on the traditional way of relying on a third party to generate random numbers. As a result, EtherSpin's betting model is more reliable.
